# DriverDrowsinessDetection

Driving while drowsy is a serious and often tragic problem. The National Sleep Foundation reported that 37 percent of people admitted to falling asleep behind the wheel. Young adults between the ages of 18â€“29 are even more likely to drive when drowsy, with a reported 71 percent compared to approximately half of those in the age range 30 to 64. A solution to this problem is to identify when a driver is falling asleep, and alarm the driver and passengers of the situation so that appropriate measures can be taken.
The monitoring system is a real-time system that can detect driver fatigue and distraction using machine vision approaches.  An approach for driver hypo vigilance (fatigue and distraction) detection based on the symptoms related to face and eye regions. In this method, face template matching and horizontal projection of top-half segment of face image are used to extract hypo vigilance symptoms from face and eye, respectively.
